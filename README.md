# Kaldo Tweaks

`Kaldo Tweaks` is a lightweight World of Warcraft Retail addon focused on small quality-of-life improvements for group play, Mythic+, UI readability, and macro automation.

The addon is built as a modular toolbox:

- enable only the features you want
- keep CPU usage as low as possible
- avoid unnecessary UI clutter
- stay compatible with existing saved settings through versioned migrations

## Local Testing

From the repository, deploy to the default WoW Retail installation:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\deploy.ps1
```

Use `-RetailPath 'D:\Games\World of Warcraft\_retail_'` for another installation,
or `-WhatIf` to preview the destination files. The script copies runtime files
and verifies their hashes; it does not delete files or modify saved settings.
Run `/reload` in WoW afterwards. Restart WoW if the TOC file list changed.

Run the regression checks from the repository root with Lua 5.1 or newer:

```text
lua tools/test_runtime.lua
lua tools/test_castbar_style.lua
```

These checks simulate the WoW APIs. In-game validation is still needed for combat restrictions and visual layout.

## Design Goals

`Kaldo Tweaks` is built around a few simple rules:

- modular first
- readable code
- backward-compatible saved variables
- restrained CPU usage
- practical UI improvements over flashy behavior

## Slash Commands

- `/kaldo` opens the addon settings
- `/kaldostatus` prints the current module status in chat
- `/kaldoinspect` opens the Group Ready summary
- `/kaldommdebug` prints Mythic+ percentile diagnostics

## Compatibility

- WoW Retail
- uses Blizzard Settings
- optional support for `LibSharedMedia-3.0`

## Notes

- Most modules are disabled by default.
- Settings are stored in `KaldoDB`.
- Existing saved variables are migrated automatically when needed.
